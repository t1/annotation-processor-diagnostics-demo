= Annotation Processor Diagnostics Demo

Demo of a minimalistic Java Annotation Processor that prints a diagnostic (ERROR, WARNING, etc.) of the annotated element.

To build it, just run `mvn`.
The `defaultGoal` is `verify`.

*This is supposed to fail* with a compile error, because in the `demo.Demo` class, there's a field annotated as `@Diagnostic(ERROR)`.

When you build this project in IntelliJ (as of version 2024.2.3), it fails and jumps to the source of the error.
You can also see all the diagnostics in the `Build Output` tool window and jump to the source by double clicking or pressing `Enter`.

But even the `ERROR` does not show up in the source editor ðŸ˜ž
